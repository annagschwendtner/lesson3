# Introduction

We analysed how common the name "Page" was in the United States in between 1900 and
2000. We used data from the USA Social Security Administration on baby names. 
We used linear regression to analyse the change of the name over time, and the 
difference of the name's popularity between men and women. 

# Results

## Prevalence by Year

We built a linear model to test the effect of year on the proportion of people 
with the name "Page". Proportion was log base 10 transformed, because it was 
not normally distributed. 
There was no significant change in the popularity of the name over time. The
positive coefficients indicates a slightly increasing slope over time.
